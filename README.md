Iteration control structure:
  This logic is used for producing loops in a program logic,when one or more instructions may be executed several times or depemding on some condition.It uses two structures called WHILE and the DO ...WHILE,both of these structures used for looping.The looping continues until the codition becomes true.
 in case of WHILE loop,the condition for looping is checked at the beginning of the loop.If the condition is false,then the loop will not be executred,otherwise the loop is executed.It is the top tested loop.
